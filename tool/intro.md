##Introduction
ADRENALIN-RV weaves monitoring code at load time and is able to instrument all loaded classes. In addition to the default classes inside the application package (APK), ADRENALIN-RV covers both the Android class library and libraries loaded at runtime from the storage, network, or dynamic generation, which static weaving won't be able to monitor.
