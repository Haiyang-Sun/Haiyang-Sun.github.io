##Introduction
TOOLNAME overcomes the limitation of static weaving on Android which cannot cover Android library and dynamically loaded classes.

TOOLNAME weaves monitoring code at load time and is able to instrument all loaded classes. In addition to the default classes inside the application package (APK), TOOLNAME covers both the Android class library and libraries loaded at runtime from the storage, network, or dynamic generation.
